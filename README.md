# tetris-clone

A simple modern tetris game website clone. Made it for fun but also improves my javascript skill and programming concept. This project is not a complete game.

Access through https://yigallim.github.io/tetris-clone/
Or use "Go Live" extension in VSCODE, and open the index.html.

The game "will" be updated someday in the future, maybe :) .
